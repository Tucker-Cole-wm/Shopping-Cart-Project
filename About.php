        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <p>On a busy night in NYC, three friends in their apartments were brainstorming on ideas for a start up that they could begin.
            After more than a few tasked hours, they settled on the apartment market.
            Being owners themselves, they thought, why not just use what they know in the market to others advantage?
            They then got to work on the framework of the business today, New York Apartments.</p>
